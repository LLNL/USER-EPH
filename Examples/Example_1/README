This example creates a 5x5x5 Ni supercell and a 1x1x1 FDM grid (electronic system).
The ionic system is at 0K initially and will be heated by electrons at 300K constant temperature (because FDM flag is not activated). 
At the end of the simulation both electronic and ionic systems will be at 300K (more steps are needed than used in the script, this depends on the coupling strength)

The electronic grid is initialised with provided parameters when defining fix (line 20). 

The ionic temperature is written to out.data and can be plotted with gnuplot:
plot "out.data" u 2:3 w lp lw 2

Also, the net energy transfer between electronic and ionic system is available in out.data and can be plotted with:
plot "out.data" u 2:4 w lp lw 2

As electrons are at higher temperature than ions the net energy will be negative at the end of the simulation.

The T.restart and struc_out.data can be used to continue simulation from last step (see Example_4).
