This example creates a 5x5x5 Ni supercell and a 3x3x3 FDM grid (electronic system).
The ionic system is at 0K initially and will be heated by electrons at 300K. At the end of the simulation both electronic and ionic systems will be near equilibrium.

The electronic grid is initialised with provided parameters when defining fix (line 20). 

The T_e and T_i during simulation are written into out.data and can be easily plotted in gnuplot with:
plot "out.data" u 2:3 w lp lw 2, "" u 2:5 w lp lw 2
Also, temperature at each grid point is written to T_out_%06d, where the number identifies the snapshot counter.

The T.restart and struc_out.data can be used to continue simulation from last step (see Example2).
