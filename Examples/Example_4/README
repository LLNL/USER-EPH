In this example a structure is read from the struc_in.data and the FDM (electronic) grid from T.in.

The electronic systemhas a source term at 0 0 0 which will input energy into the system constantly at a specific rate. This will heat the electronic grid through heat diffusion equation and, additionally, heat the ionic system due to the random force.

Total electronic and ionic temperatures can be obtained from out.data file with:
plot "out.data" u 2:3 w l lw 2, "" u 2:5 w l lw 2

Also electronic grid can be visualised with:
plot "< cat T_out_000001 | gawk '{if ($3 == 0) print $0}'" u 1:2:4 w image
