# Electronic density database
The purpose of this database is to simplify the creation of coupling files for EPH model. 
We will include spherical electronic densities for various elements in both their vacuum state as well as a few selected fittings to bulk.

Users can also contribute their own curves by sending an email to <coding@arturtamm.ee> or creating a merge request.

## Vacuum density profiles
Here is a list of elemental electronic density profiles extracted with either Opium code or calculated with Quantum-Espresso. 
The folders include the necessary input and postprocessing files for reproducing them and making minor tweaks if necessary.
