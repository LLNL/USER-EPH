The purpose of this test is to see if the EPH_Spline and EPH_Beta 
functionality is working correctly

1) Create a spline based on sin(x) in the range of [0.0:10.0] with 1001 points and tests the interpolation.
1.1) Verify that the spline values are consistent at the knot points (+-epsilon).
1.2) Verify that the spline values are within margins in between knot points.
1.3) Test runtime failures when using values outside interpolation range.


This test loads the beta file and tests the interpolation
