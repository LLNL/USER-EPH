# USER-EPH

LAMMPS extension (LAMMPS "fix") to capture electron-ion interaction.

Artur Tamm and Alfredo A. Correa (LLNL)

## Introduction

In LAMMPS, a "fix" is any operation that is applied to the system during
timestepping or minimization.  
We use this extension mechanism to generalize the two-temperature model to include electron-phonon coupling.
The extension is flexible enough to represent cascades, laser heating and equilibration and study energy transport with realistic electron-phonon coupling.
The theory is developed in the papers "Langevin dynamics with spatial correlations as a model for electron-phonon coupling" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06610) and "Electron-phonon interaction within classical molecular dynamics" (https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.94.024305).

## Installation Instructions

Get LAMMPS (source code)
```
$ cd mywork
$ git clone https://github.com/lammps/lammps.git
```

Get USER-EPH (this plugin, you have to have access to the repository)
```
$ cd lammps/src
$ git clone https://github.com/artuuuro/USER-EPH.git
```

Edit `Makefile` add string ` user-eph ` to the end of `PACKUSER` variable (near line 66).

Edit `MAKE/Makefile.mpi` and `MAKE/Makefile.serial` to read `CCFLAGS = -g -O3 -std=c++11` (near line 10).

Execute:
```
$ make yes-manybody yes-user-eph
$ make -j 8 serial
```

Make sure your MPI enviroment is setup already (`mpicxx` compiler wrapper works), this may require for example running `$ module load mpi/mpich-x86_64`
```
$ make -j 8 mpi
```

The executables are `./lmp_mpi` (for parallel runs) `./lmp_serial` (for serial runs, testing), you can copy them elsewhere.

## Usage

* Take your MD input file
* Add a line at the correct place, 
```
fix [ID] [group-ID] eph [seed] [flags] [model] [rho_e] [C_e] [kappa_e] [T_e] [NX] [NY] [NZ] [T_infile] [freq] [Te_outfile] [beta_infile] [A] [B] [C...]
```
Where:
* `ID` -> user-assigned name for the fix, [string, e.g. `ephttm`]
* `group-ID` -> group of atoms to which this fix will be applied, [string, e.g. `all`]
* `seed` -> seed for random number generator [integer, e.g. 123]
* `flags`: control of different terms or'd together [integer or bitmask]
  * `1` -> enable friction (only) (pure damping)
  * `2` -> enable random force (only) (not recommended)
  * `3` -> enable friction and random force (fixed e-temperature) 
  * `4` -> heat equation (by FDM finite difference method) (decoupled from ions)
  * `5` -> enable friction and heat equation (no feedback from e-)
  * `7` -> enable friction, random force, and heat equation (coupled e-ions)
* `model`: select model for friction and random force [integer]
  * `1` -> standard Langevin (for vanilla TTM)
  * `2` -> simple e-ph model (https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.94.024305) (not recommended)
  * `3` -> e-ph with spatial correlations, with CM-correction only (https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06610)
  * `4` -> e-ph with spatial correlations, full model (https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06610)
* `rho_e` -> scaling parameter for the FDM grid [float, recommended `1.0`] [unitless]
* `C_e` -> electronic heat capacity per volume [float, e.g. `2.5e-6`] [in eV/K/Ang^3]
* `kappa_e` -> electronic thermal conductivity [float,  ignored for single grid point] [in eV/K/Ang/ps]
* `T_e` -> electronic temperature [float, e.g. `300`] [in K]
* `NX`, `NY`, `NZ` -> grid size in x, y, and z direction [integer, e.g. `1` `1` `1` sets single grid point]
* `T_infile` -> input filename for the FDM grid parameters and initial values [string or NULL]
* `freq` -> heat map output (`T_output`) frequency, `0` to disable [integer, e.g. `10`]
* `Te_output` -> output heat map filename (CUBE format) [string, e.g. `Te_output.cub`]
* `beta_infile` -> beta(rho) input filename [string, e.g. `NiFe.beta`]
* `A`, `B`, `C...` -> element type mapping [1 or more strings, `Ni Ni Fe`]

For example the following line in LAMMPS input script, 
will run the MD including the coupling to electrons, 
within the spatially correlated Langevin bath.
The electronic specific heat is assumed to be 2.5e-6 eV/K/Ang^3 (400000 J/mÂ³/K) (see LinPRB772008) which is a good approximation for a range of electronic temperatures from 500 to 1500K. 
Initial electron temperature is set to 300K (and not from a file).
We use uniform tempetures (one grid element), therefore the heat conductivity is not relevant in this case.

```
fix ephttm all eph 123 7 4 1.0 2.5e-6 1.0 300.0 1 1 1 NULL 10 Te_output.cub Ni.beta Ni 
```

This fix produces two types of Lammps-internal results in addition to the normal MD:
* vector with the energy and temperature of the electronic system
  * `f_ID[1]` -> Net energy transfer between electronic and ionic system
  * `f_ID[2]` -> Average electronic temperature
* per atom values:
  * `f_ID[i][1]` -> site density
  * `f_ID[i][2]` -> coupling parameter

To access them in the output file add this to the LAMMPS input script:
```
fix out all print 1000 "$(step) $(time) $(temp) $(f_ephttm[1]) $(f_ephtmm[2])" file out.data screen no
dump out all custom 10 strucs_out.dump.gz type x y z f_ephttm[1] f_ephttm[2]
```

### Beta(rho) input file

This file provides the electronic densities and beta(rho) functions for individual species (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06610).
The format is described in `Doc/Beta/input.beta`. 
The file is similar to EAM setfl format. 
The beta(rho) function has units of [eV ps/Ang^2]. 
An example is provided in `Examples/Beta/Ni_model_4.beta`.

### heat equation FDM grid input file

This file is used to initialise FDM grid for the electronic system. 
The format is described in `Doc/FDM/T_input.fdm`. 
This allows fine control of the properties at various grid points. 
Also, the grid can be larger than ionic system if energy reservoir far away is needed. 
Grid points can act as energy sources, sinks or walls (individual grid points updates can be deactivated).
An example of input file is provided in `Examples/FDM/T.in`.
Units are [Kelvin], [eV/Ang^3/ps], [unitless], [in eV/K/Ang^3] [eV/K/Ang/ps] for T, local source term, rho_e, Ce, kappa_e respectively.

## Notes and limitations

* The exact physical interpretation of beta(rho) changes with the precise model. 
* `C_e`, `rho_e`, and `kappa_e` are constants at the moment (not temperature dependent).
* If `T_infile` is not `NULL` then `C_e`, `rho_e`, `kappa_e`, `T_e`, `NX`, `NY`, `NZ` are ignored and are read from the filename supplied. 
If `NULL` is provided as the filename then the FDM grid is initialised with the parameters provided in the command.

# Tutorial

Examples can be found in `Examples/` directory. 
To run them type `lmp_serial -i run.lmp` in the appropriate example directory and assuming executable is in `PATH`. 
Some of the examples may take long on older machines, so tweak the input file (`run.lmp`) accordingly. Every example contains a `README` file that describes what the runscript does.

## Example 1

`Examples/Example_1/`: 
In this example a crystal structure is created and the model is applied with both the friction and random force terms. 
The electrons are *kept* at constant temperature (300K). 
This example illustrates the thermalisation process from 0K to the target temperature through electron-ion interaction only.

```
$ cd Examples/Example_1
$ mypath/lmp_serial -i run.lmp
```

```
$ gnuplot
> plot "out.data" u 2:3 w lp lw 2
```
You will see that the ionic temperature increases and approaches the (fixed) electronic temperature (300K).

## Example 2

`Examples/Example_2/`: 
This example illustrates the use cooling of the ionic systems due to electrons only. 
This means that only the friction term acts on atoms and removes energy. 
This is equivalent to having electrons at 0K.

## Example 3
`Examples/Example_3/`: 
In this example the full model with electronic heat equation FDM grid is used. 
The crystal is created at equilibrium positions (0K) and it is heated by electrons. 
During the simulation the electronic system will cool and the ionic system heat. 
At equilibrium both systems end up at the same temperature on average. 
Also, this example illustrates the automatic initialisation of the FDM grid with constant parameters. 
The electronic temperature at various grid points is written to files (one per step) (`T_out_XXXXXX`). 
Final state of the grid is stored and can be reused in later simulations (`T.restart`).

## Example 4
`Examples/Example_4/`: 
This example reads the FDM grid parameters from a file (`T.in`). 
In this file a source term is added at grid point `(0 0 0)` representing for example a swift ion. 
During the simulation the whole system will heat and due to gradient in the electronic system forces acting on atoms at different grid points will 'feel' different random forces in magnitude.
